## Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
Objective: Understand the basics of machine learning and Python / R,etc
Experiment:
-Write a Python program to demonstrate data preprocessing steps:
 handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature
 scaling.
-Load a sample dataset using pandas (e.g., Iris or a custom dataset).
-Plot the distribution of a feature using matplotlib.pyplot.hist().
-Create scatter plots to understand relationships between features using
 seaborn.scatterplot().
-Use a correlation heatmap to find the relationship between multiple
 features with seaborn.heatmap().
