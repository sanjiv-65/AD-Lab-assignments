## Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning 
 Objective: Understand the basics of machine learning and Python / R,etc<br>
 Experiment: 
-Write a Python program to demonstrate data preprocessing steps:<br>
 handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature
 scaling.<br>
-Load a sample dataset using pandas (e.g., Iris or a custom dataset).<br.
-Plot the distribution of a feature using matplotlib.pyplot.hist().<br>
-Create scatter plots to understand relationships between features using
 seaborn.scatterplot().<br>
-Use a correlation heatmap to find the relationship between multiple
 features with seaborn.heatmap().<br>
