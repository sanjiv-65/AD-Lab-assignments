### Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning 
 Objective: Understand the basics of machine learning and Python / R,etc<br>
 Experiment: 
-Write a Python program to demonstrate data preprocessing steps:<br>
 handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature
 scaling.<br>
-Load a sample dataset using pandas (e.g., Iris or a custom dataset).<br>
-Plot the distribution of a feature using matplotlib.pyplot.hist().<br>
-Create scatter plots to understand relationships between features using
 seaborn.scatterplot().<br>
-Use a correlation heatmap to find the relationship between multiple
 features with seaborn.heatmap().<br><hr>

### Week 2: Regression Analysis
### Objective: Learn simple linear regression for predictive analysis.
Experiment:
Implement simple linear regression to predict house prices based on
features such as area and number of rooms.<br>

-Evaluate the model using metrics such as mean_squared_error and
 r2_score.<br>
-Visualize the regression line on a scatter plot of the data<br>
Note: A common dataset we can explore is the &quot;House Prices<br>
- Advanced Regression Techniques&quot; dataset from kaggle. The UCI Machine Learning
Repository has many datasets for classification, regression, and
clustering tasks. A popular dataset related to housing is the &quot;California
Housing Prices&quot; dataset.

## Week 4: Classification with Logistic Regression
Objective:Understand binary classification using logistic regression.<br>
Experiment:
Build a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or not spam.<br>
-Accuracy: A percentage indicating how many emails were correctly classified.<br>
-Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report (Classification Report: Precision, Recall, and F1-
score for both spam and non-spam classes)<br>
<div>
 Note: We will use a publicly available dataset such as the SpamBase
dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or create a simple
synthetic dataset for demonstration purposes

## classification with logistic regression
Objective: Understand binary classification using logistic regression.<br>
Experiment:
Build a logistic regression with and without regularization (L1- Lasso or L2- Ridge, or L1+L2 - ElasticNet) model to classify emails as spam or not spam.
-Accuracy: A percentage indicating how many emails were correctly<br>
classified.
ïƒ˜ Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and
classification report (Classification Report: Precision, Recall, and F1-
score for both spam and non-spam classes). Also plot the ROC curve and find the AUC values.
